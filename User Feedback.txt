I gave the program to my brother and mom. 

As is, users did not know the latitude and longitude of any city and had to look them up. longitude still doesn't work. Users checked various well known cities (New York, Olympia, etc). The program needs fixes and some more graphical enhancements could be nice.

1. points only move vertically.
2. Dijkstra's algorithm has not been implemented.
